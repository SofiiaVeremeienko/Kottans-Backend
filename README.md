Git Basics.

I am happy to be part of the Kottans training program. At Git Basics, I liked the ease of presenting information, and quizzes, short video explanations, and structured training material which made the learning process more interesting. I got a notebook in which I wrote out the basic commands for working with Git. I really enjoyed learning the Git basics with Udacity course.:)
